    "# Examining Racial Discrimination in the US Job Market\n",
    "\n",
    "### Background\n",
    "Racial discrimination continues to be pervasive in cultures throughout the world. Researchers examined the level of racial discrimination in the United States labor market by randomly assigning identical résumés to black-sounding or white-sounding names and observing the impact on requests for interviews from employers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data\n",
    "In the dataset provided, each row represents a resume. The 'race' column has two values, 'b' and 'w', indicating black-sounding and white-sounding. The column 'call' has two values, 1 and 0, indicating whether the resume received a call from employers or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the 'b' and 'w' values in race are assigned randomly to the resumes when presented to the employer."

    "<b>Test:</b> In the present case, we are testing whether there is a significant difference between the proportion of résumés with black-sounding names receiving callbacks versus the proportion of résumés with white-sounding names.  Because we testing the significance of the difference between two separate populations, a two-sample test is appropriate.  Furthermore, while we don't know the true population standard deviation for résumés with black-sounding names or for résumés with white sounding names, the samples are both sufficiently large ($n=2435$) to warrant the use of a $z-statistic$ in this analysis.\n",

    "<li><b>Independence:</b> the sample values must be independent of eachother\n",

    "\n",
    "Our sample size for both samples (résumés with black-sounding names and résumés with white-sounding names) is 2435.  If we assume that the relevant population in each case is the <i>total number of résumés</i> with black-sounding names and white-sounding names even in the U.S. alone, we can see that our sample size is clearly less than 10% of the total population of résumés in existence.  Thus, the 10% rule is satisfied.\n",
